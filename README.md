# Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Available scripts include:
* `yarn start` Runs the app in the development mode
* `yarn test` Launches the test runner in the [interactive watch mode](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
* `yarn build` Builds the app for production to the `build` folder
* `firebase deploy` Deploys the whole project to production (backend, frontend, Firestore, and rules)
* `firebase deploy --only hosting` Deploys the Rect app in the `build` folder to production
* `yarn update:models` Updates the models in the React app from `functions/src/models`

### Project structure
The project is organized as a mono-repo that includes both the front-end (React app) and the backend-end (Firebase serverless functions)
in one repository. Therefore, some things like models (schemas) are shared between those two major components to avoid replication.

             |-> models (all the models for both the front-end and the backend)
             |-> services (the main functionality of each endpoint)
             |-> index.ts (all the firebase functions endpoints)
|
|-> public (manifest, favicon, logo, etc)
|-> src (the main Rect app source code)
     |-> common (components and utilities)
     |-> course (components present in the course view including drawers, editor, exercise, forum, ranking, etc)
     |-> home (components present in the home page including footer, landing page, etc)
     |-> user (components for user view)
     |-> services (includes logic for reading and writing to firestore, connecting to firebase functions, uploading to S3, etc)
